Bump the project version using semver. Accepts one argument: `major`, `minor`, or `patch`.

## Semver rules

Given a version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- `patch` → increment PATCH, e.g. 0.1.4 → 0.1.5
- `minor` → increment MINOR, reset PATCH, e.g. 0.1.4 → 0.2.0
- `major` → increment MAJOR, reset MINOR and PATCH, e.g. 0.1.4 → 1.0.0

## Files to update

1. `package.json` — top-level `"version"` field (the source of truth for the current version)
2. `CHANGELOG.md` — new dated version section inserted above the latest entry

## Changelog format

`CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Each release is a dated heading followed by bullets grouped under bold category
labels — only include the categories that apply:

```markdown
## [A.B.C] - YYYY-MM-DD

- **Added:** new capabilities.
- **Changed:** behaviour that differs from before.
- **Fixed:** bug fixes.
- **Removed:** things taken away.
```

Bullets are full sentences (prose, not terse fragments), wrapped to roughly the
same width as the surrounding entries.

## Steps

1. If no argument is provided, ask the user which bump type they want (major, minor, or patch).
2. Read `package.json` to get the current version.
3. Compute the new version according to the semver rules above.
4. Tell the user: "Bumping version from X.Y.Z to A.B.C"
5. Update `package.json` using the Edit tool.
6. Get today's date with `date +%Y-%m-%d` for the new entry's heading.
7. Find the last release commit with `git log --oneline --grep='chore: release' -1`, then run `git log --format='%s%n%n%b' <last-release-hash>..HEAD` to gather the changes since it. If no release commit exists, use all commits from the beginning of history. Use the commit subjects and bodies as context to write the categorized bullet list for the new entry.
8. Update `CHANGELOG.md`:
   - If it does not exist yet, create it with the Write tool using the Keep a Changelog preamble, then the new version section:

     ```markdown
     # Changelog

     All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

     The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
     and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

     ## [A.B.C] - YYYY-MM-DD

     - **Added:** ...
     - **Changed:** ...
     - **Fixed:** ...
     ```

   - If it exists, read it and insert the new version section immediately before the first existing `## [` entry (i.e. after the preamble) using the Edit tool:

     ```markdown
     ## [A.B.C] - YYYY-MM-DD

     - **Added:** ...
     - **Changed:** ...
     - **Fixed:** ...
     ```

9. Report the updated version.
10. Stage the changed files (`package.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`) and commit with the message: `chore: release A.B.C`
